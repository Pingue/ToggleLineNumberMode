This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3234

switch between "Relative" and "Absolute" line number is easy with command
''':set nu'''
and
''':set rnu'''

it could be more easier by a vim script:

function! g:ToggleNuMode()
	if(&rnu == 1)
		set nu
	else
		set rnu
	endif
endfunc

and a Ctrl+L key map
nnoremap <C-L> :call g:ToggleNuMode()<cr>

this is exactly what the script does, you can just put the code into your vimrc if you don't want install a plugin :)
